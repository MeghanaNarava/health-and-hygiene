        <h2>Hygiene Awareness</h2>
        <p>1. <b>Hand Hygiene:</b> Hand washing is one of the most crucial personal hygiene practices. Regularly washing hands with an anti-bacterial soap for at least 20 seconds helps eliminate harmful bacteria and viruses, preventing the spread of illnesses.</p>
        <p>2. <b>Oral Hygiene:</b> Taking care of your oral health involves brushing teeth at least twice a day, flossing regularly, and visiting the dentist for routine check-ups. Good oral hygiene prevents dental issues like cavities, gum diseases, and bad breath.</p>
        <p>3. <b>Body Hygiene:</b> Showering or bathing daily helps keep the body clean, remove sweat, dirt, and bacteria, and prevent body odor. Using clean clothes and changing them regularly also falls under body hygiene.</p>
        <p>4. <b>Hair Hygiene:</b> Regularly washing and grooming hair keeps it clean, prevents dandruff, and maintains a healthy scalp.</p>
        <p>5. <b>Nail Hygiene:</b> Keeping nails short and clean reduces the risk of dirt and germs getting trapped underneath, which can lead to infections.</p>
        <p>6. <b>Clothing And Laundry Hygiene:</b> Wearing clean clothes and washing them regularly at the appropriate temperature helps eliminate germs and maintain personal cleanliness.</p>
        <p>7. <b>Respiratory Hygiene:</b> Covering the mouth and nose while coughing or sneezing can prevent the spread of respiratory droplets containing pathogens.</p>
        <p>8. <b>Intimate Hygiene:</b> Special care should be taken to clean intimate areas gently and regularly to prevent infections and maintain comfort.</p>
        <p>9. <b>Period Hygiene:</b> Wash your hands before and after using the bathroom. Also wash your hands before and after changing a tampon, pad, or menstrual cup.</p>
        <p>10. <b>Preventing Tooth Decay and Bad Breath:</b> Brush your teeth twice a day with a soft toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste. Clean between your teeth with dental floss or interdental brushes every day. Having regular dental check-ups is also essential.</p>
