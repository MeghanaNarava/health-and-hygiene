        <h2>Healthy Eating Habits</h2>
        <p>1. <b>Have a Glass of Milk Every Day:</b> As a staple food that is a perfect accompaniment to chocolate chip cookies, a glass of milk is loaded with 13 essential nutrients, including bone-building calcium, protein, and magnesium. If milk tends to bother your gut, try lactose-free milk or A2 milk to see if these options help.</p>
        <p>2. <b>Eat Breakfast:</b> We have all been told that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Eating breakfast consistently is linked to a greater intake of many nutrients, including folate, calcium, and iron. Breakfast skippers tend to consume significantly more calories, carbohydrates, total fat, saturated fat, and added sugars during lunch, dinner, and snacks than people who eat breakfast.</p>
        <p>3. <b>Plan Your Meals:</b> Meal planning can help people eat a healthier diet and reduce the stress of trying to figure out what to eat at the last minute. To meal-plan, figure out what you are going to eat for your meals throughout the week, make a shopping list, and prep your ingredients for quick meals for the entire week.</p>
        <p>4. <b>Avoid Eating the Same Foods on Repeat:</b> To eat a healthy diet, variety is key. Eating a wide variety of foods will give your body different nutrients and may help prevent nutritional gaps. One strategy is to "eat the rainbow," aiming to eat foods that naturally contain a wide variety of colors throughout the week.</p>
        <p>5. <b>Prep Your Veggies:</b> Before you put your groceries away, prep your veggies before you store them in the fridge. Having chopped onions and sliced cucumbers on hand makes it easy to add vegetables to your dishes or for grab-and-go snacks.</p>
        <p>6. <b>Limit Fried Foods:</b> Eating too many fried foods is linked to a slew of unsavory health outcomes, including an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. The more fried foods you eat, the higher your risk.</p>
        <p>7. <b>Add More Vegetables to Your Dishes:</b> Vegetables are one of the best sources of fiber, which supports gut health and may reduce the risk of certain cancers. Many veggies are low in calories and can make dishes more satisfying and flavorful.</p>
        <p>8. <b>Avoid Eating in Front of the TV:</b> Your meals are meant to be enjoyed. Eating while watching TV can lead to distraction, causing you to eat more calories and feel less satisfied. Eating without distractions allows you to eat mindfully and pay attention to your body's cues.</p>
        <p>9. <b>Include Fermented Food in Your Diet:</b> Kimchi, sauerkraut, and other fermented foods provide live probiotics that support overall health. Start your day with plain yogurt, enjoy miso soup at dinner, or sip on kombucha for some fermented goodness.</p>
        <p>10. <b>Add Fruit to Your Midday Snack:</b> Combining a serving of fruit with protein can help give your snack staying power, so you feel satisfied and avoid a potential sugar crash. If fresh fruit is not available, dried, freeze-dried, frozen, and canned fruit are also healthy options as long as they don't contain added salt or sugar.</p>
